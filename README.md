# Homework solutions for Parallel Processing (PP) university course

PP course was taken in 2015 as part of a Bachelor degree in Computer Science at the [Warsaw Technical University](https://www.pw.edu.pl/engpw).

Description for every problem can be found in the **tasks** directory.

Solutions are stored in the **solutions** directory. Some solutions are partial, but every solution covers at least 70% of the task description.

See short descriptions for every task below:

- **Task 1** - Design and implement the synchronization protocol based on semaphores
- **Task 2** - Design and implement the synchronization protocol based on the monitors (locks, conditionals)
- **Task 3** - Design and implement the synchronization protocol. Use the MPI library
- **Task 4** - Design and implement the synchronization protocol. Use the MPI library. Allow only local communication (each process can communicate only with the neighboring processes)

Solutions were implemented in Java programming language for problems 1 & 2 and C programming language for problems 3 & 4.
